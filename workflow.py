# This file improves retrieval quality using multi-step AI workflows.
#
# The retrieval quality problem:
# The quality of a RAG answer depends heavily on what gets retrieved.
# And what gets retrieved depends on how similar the query embedding is
# to the document embeddings. If the user's query is vague or uses
# different vocabulary than the documents, retrieval suffers.
#
# Two solutions:
#
# 1. Query rewriting: Use an LLM to rewrite the user's question into a
#    version that will produce a better embedding for semantic search.
#    "tell me about that database thing" → "How do relational databases
#    store and query structured data using SQL?"
#
# 2. Query decomposition: Some questions are actually multiple questions.
#    Split them up and retrieve separately, then combine the results.
#    This is called "multi-hop retrieval."
